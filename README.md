Django is a web framework where you can implement CRUD operations and is based on the MVT (Model View Template) architecture. CRUD stands for Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete, and these are the fundamental operations that any web developer should be familiar with.
CRUD operation provides the required tools to manipulate data in the system that allows user to do the following things according to the requirement:

Create: In a database table, create or add new entries.
Retrieve: Read, Retrieve or Fetch all or some entries from the table in a database.
Update: In a database table, update existing entries.
Delete: In a database table, delete existingÂ records.
